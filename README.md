# 8vim_keyboard_layout_calculator

This is a small python script to calculate the best possible layout for https://github.com/flide/8VIM/. It's still in the works.

The discussion regarding this program can be found here: https://github.com/flide/8VIM/discussions/138

## Setting everything up
Read every Readme found here (should be about 3?) and follow the steps described in them.

### Bigrams
A great resource is this website. http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/
I'm sure there also are other amazing websites out there, but I'm quite happy with it. You should be able to use most of their bigram-files with **8vim_keyboard_layout_calculator**.
